Me:
This is crew assign dlg on Pending list panel
Let me know if this dlg is built as you want

Client:
Should just be a list of available crew members.  I think the rest of it is not necessary at this level.

Me:
This is power dlg. So we should show available power list in this dlg?

Client:
Again.  Most of that is for TrackBoss logic when creating the service designers.  At this point, it is really about assigning power that is 1) available at city of origin and 2) is not on another train..or if it is, then the train must wait for the power to arrive to be "released" out of pending and 3) the power is not being serviced

Me:
caboose dlg?

Client:
same situation applies to caboose choices...the automation settings in service designer or for the "AI".  At this point, think of this as manual override.


Me:
Got it. let me check more.
would you check if these data are correct?

Client:
dispatcher's office not correct at all; again, we need to get to the point of trains actually being built before we do anything with that.

the status should be real time update as related to the clock.  In other words, if it is 1030am; ACL 101 would report "build time 10:30 - printed to printer XZY; power xxx assigned (or not assigned) etc.

Sorry, I don't understand about this. If you explain more details(better with example like status), I will be thankful

Client:
Working on it right now

Me:
Thanks for your help

Client:
Override selections on Build screen.docx (please check this doc from github)

Me:
Ok, thanks
Would you explain about office fields with example?
And for these dlgs (schedule and extra list panel)

Client:
First of all, when I clicked over to Service Designer from within OPS module, I returned to this screen.
something happened to the clock, trains, etc.
this is source of crew instructions...BUT, more importantly, the instructions from the Dispatcher's Office will be displayed here as the banner.
Work on those things. BUT the biggest thing is I have not seen a train actually built yet.  Perhaps you don't know what that means or waiting to get these other items addressed first?

Me:
Here is built trains

Client:
But there are no cars assigned to them.  
They have no work. 
RailOp.zip   Look at this much older program.  Play around with it and see what you see.

Me:
Ok, let me check it again
Sorry for my misunderstand
I will check this in detail and fix our OPS as you want
